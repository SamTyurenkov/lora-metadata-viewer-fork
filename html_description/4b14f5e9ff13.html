    I tried using Wan2.1 to generate videos of characters walking behind their
    backs but was unsuccessful. There were always instances of people walking
    backwards or making strange movements. So I trained this Lora, which will
    improve the success rate of generating walking back videos.

<p>Trigger word:</p>
<pre><code>walking from behind</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps increasing the number of sampling steps can lead to improvement</p>
